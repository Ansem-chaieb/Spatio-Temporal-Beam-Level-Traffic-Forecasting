# Spatio-Temporal-Beam-Level-Traffic-Forecasting
The objective of this challenge is to develop a multivariate time series forecasting model for traffic volume (DLThpVol) at the beam level. This model will be trained on high-resolution data to capture the intricacies of real-world traffic scenarios.
